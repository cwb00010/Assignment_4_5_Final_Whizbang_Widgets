# Project Overall README

## Assignment 4 API's README

### 1. Add A Seed (`spInsertSeed`) (Will Bruton)

This page allows users to input data about the seeds they use and observations regarding them. Users can provide a seed ID, seed name, and ideal planting temperature. They can also specify if the seed performs differently at various temperatures and provide other ideal temperatures for the seed. The output would be that a seed entity was created and added to the database. 

### 2. Find a User (`spGetUserDetailsByCity`) (Will Bruton)

This page enables users to search for other users based on city. Users would perform this by adding in a CityID. The return would be UserID's, Usernames, and their farm type. For example, users can search for farmers in Billings, Montana by inputting the CityID and finding out what users are farming in that area.

### 3. Add a City (`spInsertCity`)(Austin Bartley)

Users can use this page to add a city that is not already in the system. For instance, a user living in ThatSmallTown, ZipCode, BigState, CoolCountry, can add their city into the system to provide more data for the site.

### 4. Create a Profile (`spInsertUser`)(Austin Bartley)

This page allows users to insert their details to create a profile for themselves within the application. They can create a username and provide details regarding their farm and location. Address-related information is only as specific as the city to protect users' privacy.

### 5. Add a Hurricane (`spInsertHurricane`)

Users can add details about a hurricane in their area on this page. The information can later be used to analyze hurricane trends in the area. Hurricanes would be identified by an ID number and a name.

### 6. Add a Tornado (`spInsertTornado`)

Similar to the Hurricane page, users can add a tornado to the application occurring in their area. The tornado would be associated with a tornado ID number and its respective category/size. Tornadoes typically do not have names.

### 7. Weather Data (External API connecting Weather Info)

An external API connects to the basic weather page to provide weather data and information for the area. Users can view the weather for the area similar to a normal weather app.

## Assignment 5 Razor Pages README

### 1. Privacy Page (Will Bruton

This page just provides a basic privacy policy for the site that users can have access to and read. Here users can be aware of the policy at all times and can protect both us and the user. 


### 2. Users Page (Will Bruton)

The goal of this page is to provide a page where users can look at a list of other users based on CityID, username, and farm type. Depending on the amount of users this lsit could be massive. The hope would be to add some sort of filter system for users to limit the results.
